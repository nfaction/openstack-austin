# Cross Project workshops: Deployment tools discussion

<https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/newton-deployment-tools-discussion>

Heavy discussion here, will need to circle back and read again.

## Discussion

Monthly or weekly meeting to discuss progress/process via IRC, etc.  

Often we are all trying to solve the same problems, and the plan is to discuss how we can simplify and work together.

OpenStack Ansible, Chef, Puppet

## My work

First try OpenStack Ansible, and see how to modify

Then possibly modify my code to deploy "Option: 2" of the Mitaka networking set up.  This is how SuperMicro is deploying their rack in a box

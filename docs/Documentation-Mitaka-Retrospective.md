## HA Guide

I realized at this point that HA guides are very out of date and not updated often enough.  There is still large debate and how HA should *Really* be done.

Will likely just have to hash out details for HA over Ask and Mailing list, or both

New Ops guide should help

## General docs
Docs reside within each project, then all docs are aggregated into a single user guide that spans all projects.

Might be helpful to read docs for each project, then consult user guides.
